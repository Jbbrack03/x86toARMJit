# Phase 7: Testing, Optimization & Documentation - Planning Document

This document outlines the approach and tasks for Phase 7 of the XenoARM JIT project, which focuses on comprehensive testing, performance optimization, and finalizing documentation for the V1.0 release.

## 1. Overview

Phase 7 is the final phase before the V1.0 release of XenoARM JIT. It builds upon the completed implementation from Phases 0-6 to ensure the JIT meets all quality, performance, and documentation requirements. This phase is critical for validating that the JIT correctly emulates the Original Xbox CPU and performs efficiently on ARM-based target devices.

## 2. Testing Strategy

### 2.1 Architectural Testing

- **x86 Instruction Tests**
  - Implement and run `test386.asm` suite to verify correct emulation of all supported x86 instructions
  - Create targeted tests for MMX, SSE, and x87 FPU instructions
  - Test edge cases for flags computation, addressing modes, and instruction combinations

- **Memory Model Tests**
  - Expand memory model tests to include more complex scenarios
  - Test memory ordering guarantees with multi-threaded code patterns
  - Verify SMC detection in complex scenarios (e.g., self-modifying loops)

- **Exception Handling Tests**
  - Test all x86 exception vectors
  - Verify correct reporting of exception information to the host

### 2.2 Integration Testing

- **Host Stub Integration**
  - Enhance the host stub to support more realistic emulation scenarios
  - Test JIT integration with a simple memory management system
  - Implement a basic CPU state management system for testing

- **Simple Homebrew Testing**
  - Identify simple Original Xbox homebrew applications that can be run in the host stub
  - Test execution of small code snippets from actual Xbox games/demos
  - Focus on code patterns known to be challenging for emulation

### 2.3 Performance Testing

- **Benchmark Suite**
  - Develop a suite of micro-benchmarks for common instruction patterns
  - Measure translation speed, execution speed, and memory usage
  - Compare performance against baseline metrics

- **Target Hardware Testing**
  - Test on Retroid Pocket 2 Flip or equivalent ARM hardware
  - Use QEMU for testing on different ARM architectures if physical hardware is unavailable
  - Gather performance metrics specific to target platforms

## 3. Optimization Plan

### 3.1 Performance Profiling

- **Identify Bottlenecks**
  - Profile the JIT to identify performance bottlenecks in translation and execution
  - Analyze cache behavior and memory access patterns
  - Measure the impact of memory barriers on performance

- **Optimization Targets**
  - Create a prioritized list of optimization targets based on profiling results
  - Focus on high-impact areas that affect common code patterns

### 3.2 Optimization Techniques

- **Translation Cache Optimizations**
  - Improve block linking and chaining
  - Implement smarter eviction policies
  - Optimize lookup performance

  - Optimize for ARM register usage patterns

- **Code Generation Optimizations**
  - Identify and optimize common instruction sequences
  - Improve SIMD translation (MMX/SSE to NEON)
  - Reduce memory barrier overhead where safe

- **Memory Access Optimizations**
  - Optimize guest memory access patterns
  - Reduce protection overhead for SMC detection
  - Implement fast paths for common memory operations
