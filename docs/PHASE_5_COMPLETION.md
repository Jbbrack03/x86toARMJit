# XenoARM JIT - Phase 5 Completion Status

## Phase 5: x87 FPU & Advanced Exception Handling

This document provides a summary of the completed work for Phase 5 of the XenoARM JIT development plan, focusing on x87 FPU support and guest exception handling.

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. x87 FPU Implementation

- **FPU Register Management**
  - Implemented `SIMDState` class for managing the x87 FPU register stack
  - Implemented proper top-of-stack pointer management in status word
  - Added support for register tag word tracking (empty, valid, special, zero)
  - Implemented FPU mode switching between FPU and MMX operations
  - Added proper handling of FPU control word and status word

- **FPU Instruction Decoding**
  - Implemented `decode_fpu_instruction` for handling x87 FPU instructions
  - Added support for common FPU operations (FLD, FSTP, FADD, FSUB, FMUL, FDIV)
  - Created appropriate IR representation for FPU operations

- **FPU AArch64 Code Generation**
  - Implemented `FPUCodeGenerator` class for generating AArch64 code for FPU operations
  - Added code generation for FLD, FSTP, and FADD operations
  - Implemented the necessary register allocation and management for FPU operations
  - Created FPU exception detection through FPSR status checking

- **Floating-Point Format Conversion**
  - Implemented 32-bit IEEE-754 to 80-bit x87 format conversion
  - Implemented 64-bit IEEE-754 to 80-bit x87 format conversion
  - Added 80-bit to 32/64-bit conversion support
  - Implemented rounding mode handling based on FPU control word

#### 2. Guest Exception Handling

- **Exception Detection & Reporting**
  - Implemented `ExceptionHandler` class for managing x86 exceptions
  - Added support for detecting and reporting FPU exceptions (#MF)
  - Implemented callback mechanism for host emulator notification
  - Added special handling for various exception types:
    - Divide by zero (#DE)
    - Invalid opcode (#UD)
    - Page fault (#PF)
    - x87 FPU exceptions (#MF)
    - SIMD exceptions (#XF)

- **Exception Integration**
  - Integrated FPU exception detection with the FPU code generation
  - Implemented proper ARM FPSR checking after floating-point operations
  - Added status word updating based on detected exceptions

#### 3. Testing Framework

- **FPU Instruction Tests**
  - Created tests for FPU instruction decoding
  - Added tests for FPU register stack operations

- **Exception Handling Tests**
  - Implemented `FPUExceptionTest` for testing FPU exception detection and handling
  - Added tests for various floating-point exception conditions (invalid operation, divide by zero, denormals)
  - Created tests to verify exception reporting works correctly

### Remaining Work for Phase 6

1. **Complete FPU Implementation**
   - Implement remaining FPU operations (FCOM, FCOMI, FCOS, FSIN, etc.)
   - Optimize FPU register stack access
   - Improve floating-point exception handling accuracy

2. **Additional Exception Handling**
   - Implement more robust checking for complex operations
   - Integrate with host MMU for memory-related exceptions
   - Add support for recoverable vs. non-recoverable exceptions

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize floating-point conversions for better performance
   - Reduce register pressure in FPU operations
   - Implement fast-path for common FPU operations

### Conclusion

Phase 5 implementation is now complete with the minimal required functionality for x87 FPU support and guest exception handling. The implementation follows the design outlined in the project documentation, particularly `GUEST_EXCEPTION_HANDLING.md`. The code is well-structured, thoroughly tested, and ready for the next phase of development.

The foundation laid in Phase 5 provides a robust framework for handling floating-point operations and detecting/reporting guest exceptions, which are critical aspects of accurate x86 emulation.
