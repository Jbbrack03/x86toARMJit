# XenoARM JIT V1.0 Release Completion

This document marks the official completion of all planned work for the XenoARM JIT V1.0 release. The project has successfully achieved all the goals outlined in the development plan.

## Complete Development Phases

All seven planned development phases have been successfully completed:

- ✅ **Phase 0**: Setup & Core Infrastructure
- ✅ **Phase 1**: Decoder & Basic IR  
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Basic AArch64 Code Generator & Dispatcher
- ✅ **Phase 3**: Expanded Integer & Control Flow
- ✅ **Phase 4**: MMX & SSE Implementation (NEON)
- ✅ **Phase 5**: x87 FPU & Advanced Exception Handling
- ✅ **Phase 6**: SMC, Memory Model, & API Finalization
- ✅ **Phase 7**: Testing, Optimization & Documentation
