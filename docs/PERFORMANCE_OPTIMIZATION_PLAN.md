# XenoARM JIT - Performance Profiling & Optimization Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the strategy for profiling and optimizing the performance of the XenoARM JIT compiler and the AArch64 code it generates. Achieving high performance is a core goal of the project, especially on target ARM handheld devices like the Retroid Pocket 2 Flip.

## 2. Performance Goals

*   Refer to the Non-Functional Requirements in [`XenoARM_JIT_PRD.md`](../XenoARM_JIT_PRD.md:1), specifically:
    *   **NFR-01 (Performance):** Aim for significant percentage of native speed for CPU-bound tasks on representative ARM hardware.
    *   **NFR-08 (Code Generation Latency):** Minimize JIT compilation time per block.
    *   **NFR-09 (ARM-Specific Optimizations):** Leverage NEON, conditional execution, etc.
*   **Specific Targets for Retroid Pocket 2 Flip (or equivalent):**
    *   Define target scores for benchmarks like Dhrystone and CoreMark running under emulation.
    *   Aim for low average JIT compilation overhead (e.g., < 1ms per basic block, as per PRD).
    *   High Translation Cache (TC) hit rates (e.g., >98-99% for typical workloads after warm-up).

## 3. Profiling Tools & Techniques

Effective optimization requires accurate profiling to identify bottlenecks.

*   **Host-Level Profilers (ARM Linux):**
    *   **`perf`:** The standard Linux profiler. Can be used to sample JIT engine code, JITted code execution, identify cache misses, branch mispredictions, etc.
    *   **`oprofile`:** Another system-wide profiler for Linux.
    *   (Other platform-specific tools if testing on macOS ARM via Rosetta initially, e.g., Instruments).
*   **JIT-Internal Counters & Logging:**
    *   Implement counters within the JIT for:
        *   Translation Cache hits and misses.
        *   Number of x86 instructions JITted.
        *   Time spent in different JIT phases (decoder, IR, code generator, TC management).
        *   Number of register spills/fills.
        *   Frequency of execution of specific JITted blocks.
    *   Use high-resolution timers for measuring critical sections.
*   **Microbenchmarking:**
    *   Create small, targeted tests to measure the performance of:
        *   Specific JITted x86 instruction sequences or common patterns.
        *   Individual AArch64 code snippets generated for complex IR operations.
        *   TC lookup and chaining mechanisms.
*   **Host Emulator Stub Integration:**
    *   The host stub will be essential for running benchmarks and enabling profiling of the JIT in a controlled environment.

## 4. Key Areas for Optimization

Optimization efforts will focus on several key areas:

### 4.1. JIT Compilation Speed (Frontend Overhead)

*   **Efficient x86 Decoding:** Optimize the instruction decoder for speed, especially for common instructions.
*   **Lightweight IR Processing:** Ensure IR generation and any basic IR optimization passes are fast. Avoid overly complex IR transformations in V1.0 if they significantly slow down compilation.
*   **Fast AArch64 Code Generation:** Optimize the translation from IR to AArch64 machine code. Template-based generation for common IR patterns can be efficient.
*   **Reducing TC Insertion Overhead:** Ensure that storing new translations into the TC is quick.

### 4.2. Generated Code Quality (AArch64 Backend)

*   **Effective Register Allocation:**
    *   Minimize register spills and fills by making good use of AArch64's GPRs and V registers.
    *   Optimize mapping of frequently accessed guest registers.
    *   Refer to [`docs/REGISTER_ALLOCATION.md`](REGISTER_ALLOCATION.md:1).
*   **Optimized Instruction Selection for ARM NEON:**
    *   Choose the most efficient NEON instructions for emulating x86 MMX and SSE operations.
    *   Consider data layout and NEON pipeline characteristics.
*   **Efficient EFLAGS Emulation:**
    *   Minimize the overhead of calculating and updating x86 EFLAGS.
    *   Leverage ARM NZCV flags and conditional execution effectively.
*   **Branch Optimization:**
    *   Optimize direct and indirect branches in JITted code.
    *   Efficient basic block chaining in the TC to reduce dispatcher interventions.
    *   Consider code layout to improve i-cache performance and reduce branch penalties.
*   **Memory Access Optimization:**
    *   Use efficient ARM load/store instructions (e.g., load/store pair `LDP`/`STP`).
    *   Minimize redundant memory accesses if identifiable through IR.
*   **Reducing Dispatcher Overhead:** Minimize the time spent in the dispatcher itself. Direct linking/patching of JITted blocks can be more performant than always returning to a central dispatcher.

### 4.3. Translation Cache (TC) Performance

*   **Fast TC Lookup:** Implement an efficient lookup mechanism (e.g., hash table mapping guest EIP to translated code).
*   **(Future):** Smart eviction policies (e.g., LRU, LFU) if the TC size becomes a constraint and frequent evictions impact performance. For V1.0, a simple "fill and forget" or basic size limit might suffice.

## 5. Optimization Strategy & Iteration

*   **Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO) Principle:**
    1.  **Measure:** Profile the JIT and emulated application on target hardware/environment.
    2.  **Identify:** Analyze profiling data to find the most significant bottlenecks (hotspots).
    3.  **Optimize:** Implement targeted optimizations for these bottlenecks.
    4.  **Repeat:** Re-profile to verify the impact of optimizations and identify new bottlenecks.
*   **Iterative Approach:** Performance optimization will be an ongoing, iterative process throughout development, especially in later phases.
*   **Focus on Hot Paths:** Prioritize optimizing frequently executed x86 instruction patterns and JIT code paths.
*   **Balance:** Strive for a good balance between optimization complexity, development effort, and the actual performance gains achieved on the target hardware (Retroid Pocket 2 Flip). Overly aggressive or complex optimizations might not always yield proportional benefits.

## 6. Specific ARM AArch64 Optimizations to Leverage

*   **NEON SIMD:** Extensively use for emulating x86 MMX and SSE.
*   **Conditional Execution:** Utilize ARM's conditional select instructions (`CSEL`, `CSINC`, `CSINV`, `CSNEG`) to reduce branches.
*   **Load/Store Pair Instructions:** `LDP` and `STP` can improve memory throughput.
*   **Addressing Modes:** Make effective use of AArch64 addressing modes to reduce arithmetic for address calculation.
*   **Instruction Scheduling:** Be mindful of instruction latencies and pipeline characteristics of common ARM cores (e.g., those found in devices like the Flip 2, such as Cortex-A7x/A5x series). This is more advanced and might come from compiler output analysis or microbenchmarking.

## 7. Benchmarking for Optimization Validation

*   All significant optimizations should be validated by running relevant benchmarks (as defined in [`docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`](TESTING_STRATEGY.md:1)) before and after the change.
*   Track performance metrics over time to ensure no regressions occur.
