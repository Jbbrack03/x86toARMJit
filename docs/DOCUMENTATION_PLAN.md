# XenoARM JIT Documentation Plan

This document outlines the plan for creating the initial set of project documentation for the XenoARM JIT project.

## 1. Create a new directory: `/docs`

## 2. Create the following Markdown files within `/docs`:

*   **`docs/README.md`**:
    *   **Purpose:** A general introduction to the XenoARM JIT project.
    *   **Content Outline:**
        *   Project Overview (from PRD Section 1.1)
        *   Target Platform: Original Xbox (PRD Section 1.2)
        *   Core Goals (summarized from PRD Section 1.3)
        *   High-Level Scope for V1.0 (from PRD Section 2.1)
        *   Quick links to `BUILD_AND_TEST.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`
        *   Placeholder for License information.

*   **`docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Guidelines for developers who want to contribute to the project.
    *   **Content Outline:**
        *   Introduction and welcome.
        *   Setting up the development environment (referencing PRD Section 5.4: C++17/20, CMake, Git).
        *   Coding standards (language, style - placeholders for now).
        *   Process for reporting bugs and suggesting features.
        *   Pull Request process.
        *   Placeholder for a Code of Conduct.

*   **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`**:
    *   **Purpose:** A detailed description of the JIT's architecture.
    *   **Content Outline:**
        *   Introduction to the JIT's role.
        *   High-Level Design:
            *   Core Components (based on PRD Section 2.1 - JIT Engine): Decoder, IR, Optimizer, Code Generator, Translation Cache, Dispatcher, SMC Handling, Memory Interface.
            *   A Mermaid diagram illustrating the JIT pipeline:
                ```mermaid
                graph LR
                    A[x86 Instruction Stream] --> B(Decoder);
                    B --> C{IR};
                    C --> D(Optimizer);
                    D --> E(ARM AArch64 Code Generator);
                    E --> F[ARM Machine Code];
                    F --> G(Translation Cache);
                    G --> H(Dispatcher);
                    H --> F;
                    H --> B;
                ```
        *   Target CPU Emulation Details (Original Xbox - PRD Section 5.1).
        *   Target ARM Architecture Details (AArch64 - PRD Section 5.2).
        *   JIT Design Principles (from PRD Section 5.3).
        *   Key Technical Challenges (from PRD Section 5.5).

*   **`docs/BUILD_AND_TEST.md`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Instructions on how to build the project and run tests.
    *   **Content Outline:**
        *   Prerequisites (C++17/20 compiler, CMake, Git, Testing Frameworks like Google Test/Catch2 - PRD Section 5.4).
        *   Step-by-step build instructions (clone, CMake configure, compile).
        *   Instructions for running unit tests and architectural tests (PRD Section 2.1, 6.4).
        *   Debugging tips (logging, dumping ARM code, GDB - PRD Section 2.1, 5.4, 6.1, 6.2).

*   **`docs/API_REFERENCE.md` (Initial Draft)**:
    *   **Purpose:** To document the public API of the JIT.
    *   **Content Outline (based on PRD Section 2.1 - API):**
        *   Introduction to the API.
        *   Core functions:
            *   Initialization and Configuration (e.g., `jit_init()`, `jit_configure()`).
            *   Execution Control (e.g., `jit_run()`, `jit_step()`, `jit_stop()`).
            *   Register Access (e.g., `jit_get_guest_register()`, `jit_set_guest_register()`).
            *   Memory Access Hooks/Interface (description of how the JIT interacts with guest memory).
            *   Logging and Error Reporting interfaces.
        *   *(This will be a starting point and will evolve with the API development).*
