## 3. Development Phases

The development of V1.0 will proceed in the following phases. Each phase builds upon the previous one.

### Phase 0: Setup & Core Infrastructure

    *   Finalize project directory structure.
    *   Confirm and configure the build system (CMake).
    *   Set up version control (Git repository).

        *   Handle prefixes (operand size, address size, segment overrides - basic handling).
    *   Implement IR data structures as per [`docs/IR_DESIGN.md`](IR_DESIGN.md:1).
    *   Implement the translation logic from decoded x86 instructions to sequences of basic IR instructions.
