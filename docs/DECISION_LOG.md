# XenoARM JIT - Decision Log

## 1. Introduction

This document serves as a log for key architectural, design, and technical decisions made throughout the XenoARM JIT project. Recording these decisions, along with their rationale, helps maintain clarity, provides historical context for new team members (if any), and avoids re-litigating settled issues.

## 2. Log Format

Each decision entry should follow a consistent format:

---

**Decision ID:** `YYYYMMDD-NN` (e.g., `20250509-01`)
**Date:** `YYYY-MM-DD`
**Topic/Area:** (e.g., IR Design, Register Allocation, API, Tooling, Coding Standards, Build System)

**Decision Made:**
*   A clear and concise statement of the decision.

**Rationale/Context:**
*   Why this decision was made.
*   Alternatives considered (if any).
*   Key factors, trade-offs, or constraints influencing the decision.
*   Relevant discussions or research findings.

**Impact/Consequences:**
*   Expected impact on other parts of the project.
*   Implications for future development or flexibility.

**Status:** (e.g., Proposed, Accepted, Implemented, Superseded by DECISION_ID_XXX)

**Related Documents:**
*   Links to relevant sections in PRD, Architecture.md, API_REFERENCE.md, specific design documents, etc.

## 3. Log Entries

**Decision ID:** `20250509-01`
**Date:** `2025-05-09`
**Topic/Area:** Coding Standards - Formatting

**Decision Made:**
*   Adopt the Google C++ Style Guide as the base for code formatting.
*   Utilize `clang-format` for automated code formatting, configured via a `.clang-format` file in the repository root.
*   The initial `.clang-format` file will use `BasedOnStyle: Google` with minor placeholders for potential future customization.

**Rationale/Context:**
*   The Google C++ Style Guide is comprehensive, widely recognized, and promotes readability and consistency.
*   `clang-format` is a mature and widely adopted tool that automates adherence to formatting rules, reducing manual effort and style debates.
*   Starting with a well-known base style simplifies initial setup.

**Impact/Consequences:**
*   All C++ code contributed to the project should be formatted using the agreed-upon `.clang-format` configuration.
*   Developers will need `clang-format` installed or integrated into their IDEs.

**Status:** Accepted, Implemented (initial `.clang-format` created)

**Related Documents:**
*   [`docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md`](CODING_STANDARDS.md:1)
*   [`.clang-format`](../.clang-format:1)
